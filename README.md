# ES6 Library starter

Starter javascript app to help developing, building and testing ES6 javascript libraries with ease

# Prequisites

- node
- webpack
- babel

# Building library

To build your library, run `npm run build-lib`

# Development environments

To start an application for testing your library,

1. If you want to test your library over the browser then run `npm run start:browser`. The command will automatically open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). on your default browser.

2. If you want to test your library over the terminal as nodejs script then run `npm run start:node`

NOTE: In both cases, the app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files inside app directory
